Temporal Attention Mechanism is one of the oldest and most challenges in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and neuromorphic computing. The significances of investigation on the temporal attention mechanism is not only to build a more power efficient neuromorphic computing system but also to explore the knowledge of the perception system of human brain. In this paper, for the purpose of investigating the temporal attention mechanism of human brain, we proposed a hypothesis on attention mechanism with a mathematical model, utilized the proposed mathematical model to a conventional recurrent neural network (RNN). Consequently, we constructed a novel adjustable deep recurrent neural network with programmable attention mechanism. In this model, the attention mechanism is realized through programming the weights of the attention matrix. Moreover, a novel hardware implementation combining memristor and monolithic three-dimensional (3D) integration technology is developed and analyzed. Additionally, a novel nonlinear module hardware for traditional RRNs training phase is designed with memristors.  At last, the application of the proposed attention-oriented deep RNNs on neural machine translation is discussed.
