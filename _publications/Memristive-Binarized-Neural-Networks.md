Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are the brain-inspired artificial neural networks constituted by the threshold neurons, zero and one communication, and binarized weights of synapses. By using the threshold function, BNNs realize binary communications among neurons which can be represented by a single “spike”. The spike-based signal propagation between neurons minimizes the energy spent on high precision communication protocol in traditional neural networks. Furthermore, the binarized weights of synapses are clearly hardware-friendly for implementing the memristive synapse. Thereby, I propose a Memristive Binarized Neural Network (M-BNN) system which employs memristors not only as of the memory module but also as the threshold function. The input of the activation function in the M-BNN is transformed into the corresponding analog voltage as the input for a memristive threshold function module.
