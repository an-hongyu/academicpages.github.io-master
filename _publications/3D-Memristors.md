Nowadays, the emerging device Memristor attracts wide attention in neuromorphic computing and deep learning community because of its high density, low power consumption, and the nanoscale size [6]. The weights in the deep neural networks can be stored into the resistances of memristors. In this work, we fabricated and tested a two-layer memristor with additional heat dissipation layers, reducing resistance variation more than 30%, and double the device density. By testing multiple material combinations (Rh, Cr, Ti, Al2O3 Pt, and Ir), we determine the most effective material and device configuration for heat dissipation. The accuracy of ANN with memristive synapse, is significantly increased by low using variation of memristors.
