Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) offer a promising near-term solution for pushing beyond Mooreâ€™s Law because of their compatibility with current technology while providing high system speed, high density, massively parallel processing, low power consumption, and a small footprint. In this paper, a novel 3D neuromorphic IC architecture combining monolithic 3D integration and vertical resistive random-access memory (V-RRAM) technology is proposed. Furthermore, a concise equivalent circuit model of the proposed structure is created and the analytical calculation for each parameter in the equivalent circuit is provided. The electrical performance of the proposed 3D neuromorphic computing structure is evaluated through SPICE simulations.
