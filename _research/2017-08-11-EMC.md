Three dimensional (3D) integration technology
merged with neuromorphic computing system plays a significant
role for the implementation of energy efficient advanced neurobiological architecture. This work explores a novel 3D
neuromorphic system that utilizes the Through Silicon Via (TSV)
interconnects to build the complicated hardware neural structure.
It allows the ultra-high density integrated system and imitates the
neuronal membrane electrical activity in a hybrid 3D
neuromorphic system. In our designed 3D neuromorphic
structure, we extend the innovation in neuronal ion
transportation dynamics through the membrane channels using
TSVs. The commensal ionic model of a neuronal membrane is
developed utilizing the TSV property and the characteristics of
the ionic electrical activity through the TSV is determined. Having
massively parallel TSVs and configuring them into useful
capacitors, the proposed approach could significantly enhance the
signal integrity, reduce crosstalk, and thus leverage the
heterogeneous integration of 3D neuromorphic IC. The accuracy
of the proposed analytical model is evaluated through the
comparison of the model giving values to their 3D field extracting
values and SPICE simulations.
