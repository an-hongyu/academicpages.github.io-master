Neuromorphic computing, which is based on non-traditional architectures that mimic bio-neurological process, could offer
potentially disruptive capabilities and high energy-efficiency in
real-time data monitoring and prediction, and resource
allocation. The first step for de-signing neuromorphic chips is
to explore effective design methodologies for real time and
energy efficient spiking neural network (SNN) encoders and
decoders. In this paper, a spike timing dependent plasticity
principle (STDP) based decoder is designed and optimized. As
shown in our experimental results, the proposed STDP based
SNN decoder achieves good performance in information
recovery with multiple scales.
