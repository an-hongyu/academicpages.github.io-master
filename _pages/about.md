I am a junior researcher on Neuromorphic Computing, Artifical Intelligence. I received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China and an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, USA. He is currently pursuing his doctoral degree in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech. He is the awardee of the Paul E. Torgersen Research Excellence Award in 2019 and the recipient of the NSF Student Travel Fellowship Award in 2017. One of his paper has been nominated as the best paper award finalist at IEEE International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design in 2017. His research interests include neuromorphic computing, nano-electronic devices and circuits for energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
