Our Ph.D. graduate student Hongyu An won the Paul E. Torgersen Research Excellence Awards in May 2019. 
This is a very prestigious research accolade and recognizes only the top research performed by graduating masters’ and doctoral students across the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech. Hongyu is honored by his work on “Realizing Associative Memory Learning through Neuromorphic Circuits”, a cutting-edge research approach correlating two concurrent visual and auditory information together through Artificial Neural Networks. 
Hongyu currently is working on his doctoral research in our group under the supervision of Prof. Yi, Yang (Cindy). Hongyu also received the fellowship from Oak Ridge National Laboratory Advanced Short-Term Research Opportunity Program (ASTRO) and would join its top research group in neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing field this summer. 
We sincerely expect Hongyu will achieve more accomplishments in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and be more successful in the future.
