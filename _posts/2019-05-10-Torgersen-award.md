It is a great honor to receive the Paul E. Torgersen Research Excellence Awards, which is a very prestigious research accolade and recognizes only the top research performed by graduating masters’ and doctoral students across the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am awarded for my work   on “Realizing Associative Memory Learning through Neuromorphic Circuits”, a cutting-edge research approach correlating two concurrent visual and auditory information together through Artificial Neural Networks. The work has been published in 1.  H. An, Qiyuan An, Y. Yi, “[Realizing Behavior Level Associative Memory Learning through Three-dimensional Memristor-based Neuromorphic Circuits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8753741/)”, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, 2019;
