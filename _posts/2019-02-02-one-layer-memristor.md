With my friend [Mohammad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-shah-al-mamun/)’s help and [Prof. Orlowski](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/orlowski)’s support, we successfully fabricated one-layer memristor crossbar (5 by 5) in [Micro & Nano Fabrication Laboratory](https://www.micron.ece.vt.edu/) at VT. The testing for this device would be performed in the following months.
