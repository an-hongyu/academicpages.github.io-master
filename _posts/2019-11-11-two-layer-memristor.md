We successfully fabricated two-layer memristors in [Micro & Nano Fabrication Laboratory]( https://www.micron.ece.vt.edu/) at VT. In these memristive devices, we creatively added several thermal dissipation layers for mitigating heat-related resistance variation of the memristors (more than 30% improvement). I deeply appreciate my friend [Dr.Mohammad Mamun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-shah-al-mamun/) for fabricating this device and hope he has a successful career in Intel Labs! In the following months, I would test these memristors and build the model, which will be used for designing our 3D memristor-based neuromorphic circuits.
