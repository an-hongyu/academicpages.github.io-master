We successfully fabricated two-layer memristor crossbar in [Micro & Nano Fabrication Laboratory]( https://www.micron.ece.vt.edu/) at VT. In this device, we creatively added several thermal dissipation layers for mitigating heat-related resistance variation of the memristors (more than 30% improvement).
