It is definitely a great horror to work with the top research group in neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing field at Oak Ridge National Laboratory this summer. I sincerely appreciate my mentor [Dr. Katie Schuman](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/catherine-d-schuman) for her selfless and enlightening mentoring. I really learned a lot from her and all other scientists in the Computational Data Analytics Group. Moreover, It is a pleasure to make new friends across the world. They are all rising scientists in their own fields. I learned a lot of interesting knowledge of different disciplines from them.
